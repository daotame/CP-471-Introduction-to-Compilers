# CP-471-Introduction-to-Compilers
CP 471 Compiler Project

This was an individual project done in CP 471: Introduction to Compilers

What this does is it takes the code samples and compile the code into 3Tac. This was done in the span of four months. This is not perfect as there are some flaws with the project. Feel free to make some changes
